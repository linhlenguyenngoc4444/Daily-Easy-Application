# Daily Easy Application

## Project Overview

In today's fast-paced digital age, numerous applications are launched, yet most of them only serve one or two specific purposes. This causes inconvenience for users who have to download and switch between multiple apps for different needs.

Born from real-life demands, **Daily Easy** was developed as an **all-in-one** application, with a single mission: **to help users simplify their daily lives and enjoy every moment.**
